System logs
===========

Log records generated by any cluster node are collected and stored in the
leader node. See :ref:`logs-persistence-section` for additional information.

Accessing logs
==============

The System Logs page allows users to efficiently search logs based on
date, text query, or context. The available contexts include:

* **Cluster**: Displays logs from all cluster nodes.

* **Node**: Shows logs from a specific node.

* **Application**: Presents logs from a particular application instance.

Users can select between two modes of operation:

* **Dump mode**  Retrieves a limited number of log records within a
  specified time period. The maximum number of lines can be adjusted using
  the ``Max lines`` field.

* **Follow mode** Displays logs in real-time, providing live updates.

If the ``Search query`` field is set, only log records matching the given
string are returned. Only exact substring matches are allowed.

For comparative analysis of logs from two nodes or applications, follow
these steps:

- Click on :guilabel:`Add search` button.

- Optionally, switch to ``Vertical layout`` from the three-dots menu for a
  side-by-side comparison.

For example, comparing logs can be useful to see the Traefik log from one
side, to see incoming HTTP requests, and Nextcloud logs on the other side
to see that application activity.

.. note::

  By default, log searches are directed to the active Loki instance. If
  there are :ref:`inactive Loki instances <inactive-loki-section>` within
  the cluster, it is possible to select them to search past log entries.


Command line interface
======================

In addition to accessing logs via the System Logs web page, users can
utilize the ``api-server-logs`` command for log searching. Below are
examples illustrating its usage:

a) **Basic invocation:** Enters "follow mode" for the entire cluster:

   ::

     api-server-logs logs


b) **Follow mode for application instance:** Enables follow mode for the
   specified application (module) instance, such as ``traefik1``. The
   ``--entity`` flag selects the context:

   ::

     api-server-logs logs --entity module --name traefik1


c) **Dump mode for specific instance in a time period:** Initiates dump
   mode for the same instance within a specific time period. Dates must
   adhere to the ISO8601 format:

   ::

     api-server-logs logs --mode dump --entity module --name traefik1 --from 2024-04-09T16:43:22Z --to 2024-04-09T16:55:31Z


d) **Changing output timezone:** Modifies the output timezone while
   maintaining the same query. Refer to ``timedatectl list-timezones`` for
   a full list of options:

   ::

     api-server-logs logs --timezone America/New_York --mode dump --entity module --name traefik1 --from 2024-04-09T16:43:22Z --to 2024-04-09T16:55:31Z


.. _logs-persistence-section:

Logs persistence
================

Upon cluster creation, a Loki [#loki]_ core module instance is installed
on the leader node and designated as the active instance. The leader node,
like any other worker node, continuously streams its log data to this
active Loki instance [#promtail]_.


Adjusting Settings
------------------

Navigate to the ``Settings`` page, click on the System logs card and then
on the three-dots menu to modify log retention (select ``Edit retention``)
or assign a user-friendly name to the active Loki instance (select ``Edit
label``).


Understanding log retention
---------------------------

Log retention refers to the maximum age of stored log records. Records
older than the retention period are automatically purged. By default,
System logs have a retention period of 365 days, but this can be
customized to any desired duration. For compliance with common regulations
and best practices, a recommended retention period is 200 days or longer.


.. _inactive-loki-section:

Inactive Loki instances
-----------------------

When a worker node is promoted to leader, a new Loki instance is installed
on it and becomes the active instance, while the old instance is marked as
*inactive*.

- The new active instance inherits the retention setting from the old one.

- An inactive instance retains logs based on its last retention setting.

- Log searches can still be performed within an inactive instance.

- Restoring a Loki instance from backup renders it inactive.

- To remove an inactive instance, select the three-dots menu and choose
  the ``Uninstall`` action.

.. _logs-forwarding-section:

Logs forwarding
===============

On the leader node, you have the capability to forward log streams managed by the active
Loki instance to either an external syslog server or to the Cloud Log Manager.
This enables centralized log aggregation, making it easier to monitor, analyze, and troubleshoot your NethServer environment.

To enable forwarders, navigate to ``Settings`` -> ``System Logs`` page, where all Loki instances,
including the active one, are listed. Here, you can configure services by opening the Loki card menu.

If the forwarder is enabled, its status can be viewed in two places:

* On the ``Cluster Status`` page under the ``System Logs`` card.
* On the ``Settings`` -> ``System Logs`` page under the active Loki instance card.

The displayed states are:

* **Enabled**: A green circle with a description indicates the forwarder is active.
* **Failed**: A red circle with a description indicates the forwarder has encountered an issue.

.. _syslog-section:

Syslog
------
A syslog server receives, stores, and manages log messages from network devices and applications,
facilitating centralized log monitoring and analysis.

Before setting up the forwarder, ensure your syslog server is functioning properly. You will need the following information to enable the syslog forwarder:

* **Host name or IP address**: The IP address of the syslog server.
* **Port**: The port number on which the syslog server listens.
* **Protocol**: The protocol used for server communication (UDP or TCP).
* **Filter**: Choose whether to forward all log records or only those related to security events.
* **Format**: Log format (`RFC 3164 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3164>`_ or `RFC 5424 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5424>`_).
* **Export start date**: Specify from when logs should be forwarded. You can choose the last timestamp [#last_timestamp]_ or manually enter a date and time.

Cloud Log Manager
-----------------

.. note:: This service is available only with :ref:`subscription <subscription-section>`.

The Nethesis Cloud Log Manager is a centralized solution for collecting, storing,
and managing logs from various devices within an organization.
It allows for real-time event collection from systems such as Linux, Windows, firewalls,
switches, and hypervisors, centralizing all logs into a single interface.

To enable the forwarder for Cloud Log Manager, navigate to the
``Settings`` page and select ``System Logs``. Open the three-dots menu of
the active Loki instance, then click on ``Configure Cloud Log Manager``
action.  Fill the form with the following information:

* **Cloud Log Manager URL**: The URL of the Cloud Log Manager (usually
  ``https://nar.nethesis.it/``).

* **Company unique key**: This key, also known as 'tenant', identifies and
  associates the cluster logs within a company in Cloud Log Manager. You
  can find it in Cloud Log Manager web application, under Users and
  Companies > Companies.

* **Export start date**: Specify from when logs should be forwarded. You
  can choose the last timestamp [#last_timestamp]_ or manually enter a
  date and time.

Take note of the *cluster identifier*, displayed in the notice at the top of
the form. The cluster identifier value is a string like ``cluster-02834ab3``
and will appear in the Host column of the Cloud Log Manager web
application.

Once the form is saved, the export procedure begins. After a few minutes,
the cluster security logs will be available at https://naradmin.nethesis.it/.

Only security logs are forwarded to the Cloud Log Manager. To forward the
full log stream, which may generate considerable data, refer to
:ref:`syslog-section`.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#loki]

    Grafana Loki is a special database designed to store, index and search
    system logs. For more information, see
    https://github.com/nethserver/ns8-loki

.. [#promtail]

  The promtail.service core service operates on every node, reading system
  journals, forwarding new records to the active Loki instance, and
  preserving the last sent journal cursor position to ensure seamless
  restarts without log loss.

.. [#last_timestamp]

  Last timestamp indicates the last time that the forwarder successfully sent logs.
  This allows the forwarder to resume forwarding from where it was interrupted, ensuring continuity in log management.

Samba file server
=================

The Samba_ file server application provides shared folders and home
directories to users and groups within an Active Directory domain.

.. _Samba: http://www.samba.org

Only one instance of Samba can be installed per NS8 node. The installation
method depends on the role Samba will play in the Active Directory domain.

- **Domain Controller**: To install a Samba instance as an Active
  Directory Domain Controller, refer to :ref:`active_directory-section`.
  When configuring it as an account provider, ensure the ``Provide
  file shares and authentication to Windows clients`` switch is enabled.

  Only one AD domain controller can be configured with a LAN IP address
  to serve Authentication, Shares, and DNS to Windows clients. Other DCs
  are bound to the cluster private VPN and are accessible only to cluster
  applications.

- **Domain Member**: To install a Samba instance as an Active Directory
  Domain Member, start from the Software Center as with any other
  application. A domain member can connect to both internal and
  external AD providers. See :ref:`user-domains-section`.

.. _samba-configuration:

Configuration
=============

When Samba is installed as a **domain member**, a first-time configuration
procedure starts to collect essential information.

- **Domain**: Select an item from the list of available NS8 user domains.
  Only internal and external Active Directory domains are listed.

- **Admin credentials**: These are required to join Samba to the domain as
  a file server member. Enter the username and password of a member from
  the Active Directory "Domain Admins" group.

- **File server name and alias**: Assign a unique computer account name to
  Samba. Choose carefully, as this cannot be changed later. The alias
  name is optional and can be changed at any time.

- **File server IP address**: Select the IP address for the file server.

.. _file-server-alias:

File server alias
-----------------

Once the first-time configuration procedure is completed, use the
``Settings`` page from the left menu to modify the optional ``File server
alias`` value. The server alias name is useful for migrating and consolidating
shared folders from another server. The alias name is added to the Active
Directory DNS as a CNAME record pointing to the Samba file server name.
The alias name is also added as a Service Principal Name (SPN) to the
computer account.

.. _file-server-address:

File server IP address
----------------------

In some cases, it is also possible to modify the ``File server IP
address`` and choose a different private IP address from those assigned to
the node. Note that a domain controller cannot change its IP address if
there are other domain controllers in the same AD domain.


Shared folders
==============

Open the Samba application from the app drawer, select ``Shared folders`` from
the left menu, and click on :guilabel:`Create shared folder`.

The following parameters are required to create a new shared folder:

- **Name**: The name of the shared folder. Avoid naming it after a domain
  user, as that user's home directory will be accessed instead
  of the shared folder.

- **Description**: Free text displayed to network clients as the "share
  comment".

- **Main group**: Select a domain group to assign initial permissions to the share.

- **Initial permissions**: Choose one of the three available options. Note
  that the ``Domain Admins`` group is initially granted full privileges in
  all cases.

  1. Main group can read and write; everyone else can read.

  2. Main group can read and write; everyone else has no access.

  3. Everyone can read and write, including the main group.

.. note::

    To access the shared folder, you must provide valid domain
    credentials. Anonymous or guest access is not allowed for security
    reasons [#anon]_\ .

Once created, the following actions are available on the shared folder
from the three-dots menu:

- **Edit**: Change the share description displayed to network clients as
  the "share comment".

- **Set permissions**: Remove any existing ACLs and recursively grant new
  initial ACLs.

- **Restore file or folder**: Search files and folders from a past backup
  snapshot and restore them. See :ref:`share-selective-restore`.

- **Delete**: Remove the shared folder and its contents.

The :guilabel:`Show ACLs` button displays the filesystem ACLs applied to
the shared folder root directory. You can edit ACLs with an SMB
client, such as the Windows Explorer application installed with Windows Pro
editions, or the ``smbcacls`` command provided by the Samba project.

In both creation and edit workflows, some additional settings are available
under the ``Advanced`` section and are described below.

.. _share-audit-logging:

Audit logging
-------------

If the ``Audit logging`` switch is enabled for a shared folder, access
operations and permission changes are recorded in a database. For
troubleshooting purposes, you can enable the recording of failed
operations with the ``Log failed events`` switch.

Recorded events are accessible from the ``Samba Audit search`` Grafana
dashboard, as explained in :ref:`grafana_access-section`.

More information about the audit database is available from the ``Samba Audit
statistics`` Grafana dashboard.

.. _share-browseable:

Folder visibility
-----------------

The ``Make folder visible when browsing`` switch controls whether the shared
folder is listed from the network. If the switch is disabled, accessing the
share is possible only by knowing its name and network path.

This feature is also referred to as a *hidden share* or the *share
browseable/browsable* attribute.

.. _share-recycle:

Recycle bin
-----------

The ``Keep deleted files in a recycle bin`` switch enables a special "Recycle bin"
subfolder where files or directories are moved instead of being deleted when
network clients attempt to delete them.

- **Retention**: If a limited number of days is set, a daily automated
  procedure erases Recycle bin contents older than the specified number of days (default: 30).

- **When files with the same name are deleted**: Determines whether to keep just a
  single version of a deleted file with a given name, or multiple versions
  of it.

.. _share-selective-restore:

Restore a single file or folder from a shared folder backup
-----------------------------------------------------------

If the application has one or more backup destinations configured and a
backup has already been executed, you can search for and restore a file or
folder from a past backup snapshot of a specific shared folder.

.. warning::

  The procedure does not calculate the disk space usage required for the
  restore. Ensure sufficient disk space is available before proceeding.

#. Navigate to the Samba application instance and open the Shared Folders
   page. Each shared folder is displayed as a card. From the three-dots
   menu of the desired shared folder, select ``Restore file or folder``.

#. Choose the backup destination from which to restore the contents.
   Loading remote destinations may take some time.

#. Select the date of the backup snapshot to restore. Snapshots are
   listed from newest to oldest.

#. Start typing the name of the file or folder to restore. The search
   matches both the name and the relative path, starting from the root of
   the shared folder. Results are ordered with name matches appearing
   before path matches. Select an item from the results.

   Click :guilabel:`Restore` to initiate the restore process.

The selected item will be restored into a subfolder of the shared folder,
named "Restored folder". This folder is readable by everyone, while its
contents retain the ACLs from the backup.


.. _file-server-clone:

Clone a file server instance
============================

When Samba has the Domain Member role, it is possible to clone it as
described in :ref:`move_clone-section`.

After the clone process finishes, navigate to the Samba application
``Status`` page. The first-configuration procedure will start to acquire
the missing information. A new computer account is created in Active
Directory. Follow the procedure as described in
:ref:`samba-configuration`.

.. _file-server-restore:

Restore file server from backup
===============================

First, follow the procedure described in
:ref:`application_restore-section` by selecting the backup of the **Samba
module**.

After the restoration process completes, further actions may be needed to
start the file server, depending on the original Samba role: member or
controller.

Restore a domain member
-----------------------

To complete the restoration of a **domain member**, navigate to the Samba
application ``Status`` page.

- If the original IP address and user domain were found, the restore
  procedure automatically starts the file server. No manual operations are
  needed.

- Otherwise, the first-configuration procedure will start to acquire the
  missing information. In this case, a new computer account is created in
  Active Directory. Follow the procedure as described in
  :ref:`samba-configuration`.

  If you manually remove the original computer account, you may set the
  original name as the ``File server alias`` to provide seamless access to
  shared folders from network clients.

  To manage computer accounts of an NS8 internal Active Directory domain,
  invoke the ``samba-tool`` command from an NS8 node that hosts a Samba
  Domain Controller. For example, this command prints an inline help
  message: ::

    runagent -m samba0 podman exec -ti samba-dc samba-tool computer

  Replace ``samba0`` with your correct DC module identifier.


Restore a domain controller
---------------------------

If the restored **domain controller** is the first in the domain, there are
two alternatives:

1. If the system IP address is the same as the one used in the backup set, DC
   services are started automatically and no further actions are required.

2. If the previous condition does not apply, DC services are started using
   the system VPN IP address as a fallback. A similar command is required to
   select another IP address at a later time: ::

     api-cli run module/samba0/set-ipaddress --data '{"ipaddress": "10.15.21.100"}'

   Replace ``samba0`` with the correct module identifier. Replace the
   ``ipaddress`` value with the correct IP address.

Otherwise, if one or more domain controllers already exist:

- Go to the ``Domain and users`` page and open the :guilabel:`Unconfigured
  provider` link.

- Fill the form to join a new DC to the domain.

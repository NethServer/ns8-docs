===================
System requirements
===================

NethServer 8, abbreviated as NS8, can be deployed on a single node or
across multiple nodes in a clustered configuration.

NS8 is currently available only for `x86-64 architecture
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64>`_.

Minimum hardware requirements for a single node installation:

- 2 vCPU/cores
- 2GB RAM
- 20GB disk

More nodes can be added later, and when adding a new node, it is
recommended to use similar hardware and the same Linux distribution
installed on the other nodes.

.. _supported-distros-section:

Linux distribution
==================

Install NS8 on a clean Linux server distribution, avoiding installation on
desktop systems or servers already running other services.

Supported GNU/Linux distributions and versions:

- `Rocky Linux <https://rockylinux.org/>`_ 9
- `CentOS Stream <https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/>`_ 9
- `AlmaLinux <https://almalinux.org>`_ 9
- `Debian <https://www.debian.org/>`_ 12


.. _static-ip-reqs:

Static IP address
=================

Assign a static IP address to the server. DHCP and any other
dynamic IP discovery protocols are not allowed.

.. _dns-reqs:

DNS configuration
=================

As you are configuring a server, network clients must resolve its fully
qualified domain name (FQDN) to a routable IP address with the DNS. This
is a requirement to connect with the server.

A correct FQDN and DNS setup is also a requirement for TLS encryption to
work properly. Once connected with the server, network clients check if
the TLS certificate is valid for the given FQDN.

1. Depending on your server purpose, DNS can be provided by a public
   internet service, a private network appliance, or even both of them.
   Read carefully and understand their documentation.

2. Decide the FQDN of your server and register it in the DNS with the
   server public IP address. A FQDN is composed by the host name prefix (a
   single word) and the DNS domain suffix. For instance, host name can be
   ``jupiter`` and domain suffix ``example.org``: the resulting FQDN is
   ``jupiter.example.org``.


.. _worker-node-reqs:

Worker node requirements
========================

.. highlight:: text

Among network clients, a worker node has some special
requirements to be installed and configured.

The worker node reaches the leader during the join procedure at the
following URL: ::

    https://<leader_fqdn>/cluster-admin/

Ensure the following requirements are met:

1. the worker node must resolve the leader FQDN to the correct routable
   address

2. the HTTPS server (TCP port 443) at that address must handle the API
   request

3. the API server response contains the leader ``VPN endpoint``: it is a
   host address with a UDP port number used to set up a Wireguard VPN. The
   VPN endpoint is configured during the :ref:`cluster creation
   <post-install-steps>` procedure. Ensure it is not blocked by other
   network appliances.


Web browser requirements
========================

To access the cluster administration web user interface, you need an
up-to-date release of Firefox, Chrome, or Chromium browser as the web
client.

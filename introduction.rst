About NethServer 8
==================

NethServer 8 (abbreviated as NS8) is a `GNU/Linux
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`_ application server designed for
small offices and medium enterprises. Applications can be managed from a
simple Web user interface.

Under the hood, NS8 is a container `orchestrator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing)>`_.
It can host different applications on a single machine or spread the load across multiple nodes.

NS8, is the evolution of `NethServer 7
<https://docs.nethserver.org/en/v7/>`_. It is no longer a complete Linux
distribution based on CentOS, instead it can be installed on different
Linux distributions.

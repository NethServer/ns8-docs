About NethServer 8
==================

NethServer 8 (abbreviated as NS8) is a `GNU/Linux
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`_ application server designed for
small offices and medium enterprises. Applications can be managed from a
simple Web user interface.

Under the hood, NS8 is a container `orchestrator
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing)>`_. It can host
different :ref:`applications <applications-section>` on a single machine
or spread the load across multiple nodes.

NS8, is the evolution of `NethServer 7
<https://docs.nethserver.org/en/v7/>`_. It is no longer a complete Linux
distribution based on CentOS, instead it can be installed on different
Linux distributions.

It is heavily-coupled with the underlying OS. It installs applications
using RPMs package and configure them with a configuration management
system called e-smith.

NethServer 8 can run on different :ref:`Linux distributions <supported-distros-section>`.
It installs applications using containers and configures them using
a multi-node architecture.

As NS7, NS8 is perfectly suited for small offices and medium enterprises.

What can I do with NethServer 8?
================================

You can serve an Active Directory domain with Samba 4, or just a simple OpenLDAP server.
You can host multiple instances of the same application connected to different local or
remote domains.

If you need a new domain, just create a new node and join it to the existing cluster:
you can spread the workload across multiple machines.
Of course, everything is under your control just from the UI of the main node.
No matter if nodes are local or remotes, they are securely connected with an encrypted VPN.

If you like an all-in-one server. you can do it too.
